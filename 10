Make a program that counts how many thousands in a number.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters numbers. e.g '1500 5900 250 1' (without quotes)
3. The program prints '1 5 0 0'

Note: Floating points such as 1.5 are not allowed. Please floor the decimal to the nearest smallest integer.
