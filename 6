Make a program that calculates the variance of different numbers.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters numbers. e.g '2 5 8 7' (without quotes)
3. The program calculates the variance of the different numbers, and prints them out.

Required:
- Variable update. For example, X = X + 1
