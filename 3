Make a program that calculates the mean average of certain values

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters numbers. e.g '2 5 8 7' (without quotes)
3. The program calculates the mean value and prints it. In this case, it is 5.5.

Note: The amount of numbers given is not always 4. The user might give '8' or '9 8 4 0 4 5' (without quotes), make the program handle these different sizes.
