Make a program that prints certain characters according to certain rules.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters text. e.g 'e hello' (without quotes)
3. The program prints 'hlo'.

How it works?
The first letter is either 'e' or 'o' to indicate even or odd respectively.
The remainaing text is the text to be analyzed, in the case of 'hello' :

h e l l o
0 1 2 3 4

Print only characters with even indexes 0,2, and 4. The output is 'hlo'.
