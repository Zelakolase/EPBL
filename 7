Make a program that asks the user if he is happy or sad, then print a quote to make him happy if he is sad.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters text. e.g 'iam sad' (without quotes)
3. The program prints a quote of your choice.

Note: To know he is sad, check if the text he inputted contains 'sad' in the text.
