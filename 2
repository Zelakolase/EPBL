Make a program that finds the smallest and biggest number in given collection of numbers by the user.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters numbers. e.g '2 5 8 7' (without quotes)
3. The program extracts the smallest number and the biggest number, in this case 2 and 8. Prints them.

Output example:
Biggest number is 8
Smallest number is 2

Note: The amount of numbers given is not always 4. The user might give '8' or '9 8 4 0 4 5' (without quotes), make the program handle these different sizes.

Required:
- Loops
