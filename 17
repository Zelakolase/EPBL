Make a program that reads and writes on files.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters text. e.g 'r test.txt' (without quotes)
3. The program reads 'test.txt' in the current directory

Example test cases:
'r test.txt' -> Prints the content of 'test.txt'
'w test.txt hi' -> Writes 'hi' to 'test.txt'

Required:
- Input/Output on disk
