Make a program that compares two numbers together and sees if they are equal, bigger, or smaller that the other one.

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters numbers. e.g '2 5' (without quotes)
3. The program compares the first number with the second number. For example, If 2>5, we say it is bigg, 2<5, we say it is small.
The states that the program can print is 'equal' or 'big' or 'small'

Note: We ONLY compare the second number respective to the first one.
