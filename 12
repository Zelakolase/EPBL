Make a command prompt that can execute programs in task.2,3,8 or print time and date.

Commands :
'mean 5 4 1 0' -> Prints the mean average of 5,4,1, and 0.
'sb 4 5 3' -> Prints the smallest and biggest number of 4,5, and 3.
'c Hi' -> Prints how many letters are in the text 'Hi'.
'time' -> Prints current time and date

Example: 
1. The user executes the program
2. The user enters text. e.g 'time' (without quotes)
3. The program prints the time and date, then listens again to the user input.
